# Speak — build a macOS release: universal .ofx bundle, double-clickable .pkg
# installer, and a zip fallback with a .command install script.
#
# Release path (default): sign with Developer ID, notarize the BUNDLE, staple
# it, and only then build the pkg and the zip from the stapled copy, so both
# artifacts inherit a ticketed payload. Every missing credential is FATAL —
# the fail-open guards this script used to have are exactly how 0.2.0 and
# every Hush release before 3.7.0 shipped Gatekeeper-rejected while the
# script reported success.
#
# CI path (explicit, never silent): CI_UNSIGNED_DEV_BUILD=1 stages an
# ad-hoc-signed bundle and zips it with "-ci-unsigned" in the name, so the
# credential-less CI runner still exercises staging and packaging. That
# artifact is a dev convenience, not a release, and its filename says so.
